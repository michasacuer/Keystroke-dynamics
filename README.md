Keystroke dynamics, keystroke biometrics, typing dynamics and lately typing biometrics, is the detailed timing information which describes exactly when each key was pressed and when it was released as a person is typing at a  keyboard.

My Keystroke Dynamics is simple app to user recognition based on **REALESE TIME**.
Why Realese time?

Because Android not provide any features for catching **KeyUp** and **KeyDown** events for Software keyboard. Key pressing time is more 
accurate, but its impossible to get it from default keyboard on Android device.
